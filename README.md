# ESPHome HAN P1

This firmware is intended for the SlimmeLezer device product. It differs from the SlimmeLezer in the following aspects:
- It is not intended to be used in a Home Assistent context. The Native API has been removed since it will make the device reboot periodically in case no Home Assistant is available.
